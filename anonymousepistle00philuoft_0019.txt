An Anonymous Epistle os Dido to Aeneas 17

POEM

Injured love should have written no word of greeting to one
who is ungrateful. But reproaches are no remedy for tears—
if only there were time for tears! Instead the cruel fate of
death summons me. Guilty Trojan, is this the gift you send
me in return? However often I try to still my weeping by
writing bitter verses, my very grief proves stronger; no
words can satisfy the grief that my too patient heart endures,

 

inproba: Riese changes the ms. reading to inprobe, apparently because
the vocative occurs in 34 and 124. There is no reason for any change ;
inproba is an appropriate epithet to apply to sata.
mortis sala: cf. Cic. Tim. 40 neque vos ulla mortis sala perimenl,· also
the Homeric κῆρες Θανάτοιο, Il. 2. 302, 834; 12. 326, etc.
9. sata vocant: cf. Verg. Aen. 10. 471-2
el iam sua Turnum
Fata vocant.
Ov. Epist. 6. 28 me quoque fala vocant.
7. 1 Sic ubi sala vocant.
Sil. 16. 698—9 Talibus adcensi patres, satoquo vocante,
Consulis adnuerunt dictis.
Voco and καλέω are used especially of the summons of death or of the
dead ; see Peerlkamp's note on Hor. Carm. 2. 20. 6, where examples are
cited.
‘nocens is a favorite word of our author, cf. 24, 39, 99, 124, 132.
dona refers to Dido’s death (mortis fala), as Wernsdorf points out, not
to the sword with which she killed herself, as Burman took it. The
same idea is repeated in 31 H cmc reddis, Troiane, vicem?
remittis: i. e. as a return for the kindness that I have shown you.
10. For the thought cf. Hor. Carm. 4. 11. 35-36 M inuenlur atrae carmine curae,
and Ov. Trisl. 4. 10. Ill—2 Hic eqo, finitimis quamvis circumsoner armis,
Tristia quo possum carmine sala levo.
yravi applied to poetry generally means serious, or on a serious theme.
Here it refers rather to the bitterness of Dido’s feeling toward Aeneas.
12. patientis suggests too patient endurance. Cf. Bell. Afr. 31. 8 pali-
entem se timidumque hostium opinioni praebebat. Nep. Epam. 7 fuisse
patientem suorumque iniurias serentem civium.
