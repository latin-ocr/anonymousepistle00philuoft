An Anonymous Epistle of Dido to Aeneas 43

and exiled, shipwrecked‚ your fieet scattered over the waves,
to say nothing of all the disasters that you saw threatening you.
Although all this had been your lot, yet Carthage offered you a
throne. Whom will you worthily repay, if you desire cruelty
for me?

There is no reason for my demanding a cruel requital. Ι
should wish rather to have given in vain! What Ι could lose,
I never count as loss. But, traitor‚ grant me at least what
love owes itself, if deeds of kindness deserve no reward.

Nature teaches that there are· gods, experience proves that
they are not to be feared. How can I not believe it?

ly I do not desire to exact vengeance because my kindness has been
wasted.'’
