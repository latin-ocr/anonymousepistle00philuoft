Future participle used more frequently than in the classical

deret Aenean (Dict. 28). The grammarian was occupied with Vergil to such
an extent that to say he knew Vergil was sufficient designation of his calling,
as in the epigram beginning Arma virumque docens atque arma virumque peri·
tus, Baehrens Poetae Latini M inores 5, p. 98.
