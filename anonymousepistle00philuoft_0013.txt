An Anonymous Epistle os Dido io Aeneas 11

SIGLA*

A= Codex Parisinus 10318, commonly known as Salmasianus‚
from its former owner Salmasius (Claude de Saumaise), into
whose possession it came between the years 1609 and 1620.
This is the only original ms. authority. It is written in uncials‚
and belongs to the seventh, or perhaps the beginning of the
eighth century. A description of it, with an account of its his-
tory, is given by Riese (pp. XII ff.); see also Traube, Philologus
54, p. 124. It is reproduced in facsimile under the title: Bib-
liothcque N ationale: departement des manuscrits: Anthozoqie de
Poe-tes Latius dae de Saumaise; reproducaon reduite du manu-
scrit en onciale, Latin 10318, de la Bibliothaque N aumerle,- Paris,
1903.

A' = Corrections of A in the original hand.

a = Emendations of Salmasius, written in the margin of A.

α = Emendations made by the writer of the schedae Di-
vionenses, a copy of A made at Divio (Dijon) between the years
1651 and 1756, and now at Heidelberg. This ms. was used by
Burman, who regarded it as of great value.

C = Codex Parisinus 8069, containing selections which were
probably intended for use in schools; see Riese pp. XLI-XLII.
It contains only two verses of this poem, 4 and 6.

The apparatus criticus is based on that of Riese's second
edition, but for the sake of the completeness which seems de-
sirable, a number of proposed conjectures are included which

Riese does not note.
The text represents the reading of A when not otherwise noted.

The abbreviations used in the notes are those of the The-
saurus Linquae Latinae.

 

*Those used in Riese’s edition; see Riese p. 33.
