An Anonymous Epistle os Dido to Aeneas 23

husband to whom Ι too belonged. Never will mutual vows gain
credence, if such faith as mine is not worthy of a husband's love.
Trojan, is this the return you make? Is this what my love de-
serves‘? Does the remembrance of our marriage couch not hold
you, nor the oaths of fidelity that we there exchanged‘? As if
guilty of crime do I lose all that I gave for love?

Grant that it is by the decrees of fate, base wretch, that you
are seeking a kingdom that will rival mine, there is no reason,
traitor, for your reiterating this; by treachery, not by fate,
is your honor lost. But (you say) you were seeking the
kingdom that was rightfully yours‚ you could not overcome

 

32. conscia lecti: cf. Verg. Aen. 4. 167ψὸ conscius aether conubii (or conubiis

according to another reading).
Mart. 14. 39 Dulcis conscia lectuli lucerna,
Quidquid vis facias licet, tacebo.
32-33. Cf. Verg. Aen. 4. 307-8

Nec te noster amor, nec te data dextera quondam,

Nec moritura tenet crudeli sunere Dido?
The whole series of questions in this passage is modeled on Dido’s ap-
peal to Aeneas in Verg. Aen. 4. 305—330.

33. Sacramenta seems to be used, as Wernsdorf says. with special reference
to marriage, as in late and ecclesiastical Latin. Cf. Mart. Cap. 2. 117
sonus . . . quem Musarum convenientium chorus impendens *nup-
tialibus sacramentis concinebat. The word properly means something
which is set apart as sacred, also, in the active sense, something
which sets apart; the latter gives its commonest meaning in classical
Latin, the oath of allegiance taken by a soldier. From this it may be
used to mean any solemn oath or pledge. By Christian writers it is used
to translate the Greek μυστήριον, and applied to the sacraments of the
church.

34. inprobe: Vergil makes Dido address Aeneas with this epithet (Aen. 4.
386), also with perfide (Aen. 4. 366).
tendes with accusative of limit of motion = “make your way to,” “go
to,” as in Verg. Aen. 1. 553—4

Si datur Italiam sociis et τεῖρε recepto
Tendere
and 6. 696 haec limina tendere adeyit.

35. nihil est quod occurs again in 39 and 117. In 39 it is used in a somewhat
different sense, and is followed by the indicative.

36-37. Sed reyna etc.: this refers to Aeneas’ defense of his conduct, end-
ing with Italiam non sponte sequor (Verg. Aen. 4. 333—361) and Dido's
scornful reply (376-380). Cf. Ov. Epist. 7. 139

“Sed iubet ire deus’'. Vellem vetuisset adire.
