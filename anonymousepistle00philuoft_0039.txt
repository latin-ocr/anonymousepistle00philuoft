An Anonymous Epistle of Dido to Aeneas 37

light nor take any respite throughout the fleeting year; but
baffled in its hopes it only keeps alive its own wounds, in the
midst of a thousand deceits and as many atonements for faith-

lessness.

I break forth into complaining wishes: I would rather weep at

home, doomed to perish with complaints unuttered, Ι would
rather exhaust my sorrow in silence. But grief itself denies me
what shame before denied. ⁴&Love has bidden me write, hapless
that I am, “2th myfiowngfault have made an honorable compact. w

tacitos consumere: Burman's correction, to which the ms. seems to point.
For consumere cf. Cic. Phil. 2. 64 Consumptis enim lacrimis tamen in·

fixus animo haeret dolor.
Sen. Dial. 6. 8. 1 Dolorem dies lonya consumit.

quod pudor neqavit: i. e. the comfort of the free expression of her feel-
ings‚ cf. 6 and 22—3. Pudor at first kept her from making any appeal;
now dolor does not allow her the solace of keeping her suffering to her-
sels.

Scribere iussit amor: cf. Ov. Epist. 4. 10
Dicere quae puduit, scribere iussit amor,
and 20. 230 H aec tibi me viqilem scribere iussit amor.
For pudor and amor opposed to each other cf.
OV. Am. 3. 10. 28—9 Hinc pudor, ex illa parte trahebat am0r;
Victus amore pudor.
Met. 9. 514—5 Coyet amor, potera· vel si pudor ora tenebit,
[sittera celatos arcana fatebitur iynes.

miseram me: a common expression in Vergil, e. g.

Geory. 4. 494 “Quis et me'’ inquit “miseram et te perdidit? ''
Ecl. 2. 58 Quid volui misero mihi!

Aen. 2. 70 Quid iam misero mihi denique restat?

See also Aen. 4. 315, 4203 9. 285; 10. 849.

culpa: nominative; literally “whose fault has made,” etc. The word
refers to Dido’s love, which restrains her from doing Aeneas any harm.
The expression is thus interpreted by Wernsdorf: “Miseram me, quae
mea culpa honestum hospitii et coniugii foedus cum Aenea feci, cuius
fide nunc impedior quominus nefas aliquod in eum cogitare et me ul·
cisci possim.''
Poteram: i. e. “1 was angry enough to.’' Cf. Verg. Aen. 4. 600-602

Non potui abreptum divellere corpus et undis

Sparqere, non socios, non ipsum absumere ferro

Ascanium patriisque epulandum ponere mensis?
