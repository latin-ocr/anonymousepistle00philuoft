28 An Anonymous Epistle os Dido to Aeneas

50 Lege poli, peraguntque micantia sidera cursus.
Navifragi tacet unda salis, nec murmurat auster,
Nec flexum quatit aura nemus. Sua taedia solus
Fallere nescit amor. Pinnis modo garrula pendens
Iam philomela tacet damno male victa pudoris,

 

51. Nauifrage A, corr. a sali Burman 52. NeA 53. pinnis (primis α)
gatula mane pendens A, modo scripsi, ramis male garrula pendens Burman,
pinnis ad germina tendens Baehrens, pinnas curvamine pandens Traube

50. Riese supposes a lacuna between 50 and 51, containing the end of the
comparison between day and night, and the beginning of one between
calm and storm. There is no necessity for this; peace and quiet are
regarded as an essential element of night, as in Vergil's description (Aen.
4. 522—8) which this passage imitates. Other aspects of night are
dealt with in the next two “stamas”

micantia is regularly used of the stars, e. g. Lucr. 5. 1205, Hor. Carm. 1.
12. 46, Sen. Herc. Fur. 125, Oed. 46, etc.

51. Navisrayi: cf. Verg. Aen. 3. 553 navifrayum Scylaceum, and Ov. Met.
14. 6. navifragum fretum.

52. flexum: proleptic, cf. reparatum, 43, and mersum, 48.

53. The unmetrical ms. reading has caused great difficulty. Riese adopts
the change due to Burman, explaining male yarrula as = iam non ya-
rula. It is true that male with certain adjectives practically = non, but
only with adjectives whose meaning is such that the quafflying adverb
“badly'' would negative their meaning. as is the case with sanus, yratas,
fidas. “Badly garrulous,” however, is not equivalent to “silent''

F urther, pinnis has to be changed to ramis to fit the context. Other
emendations proposed by Baehrens and Traube have still less probabil-
ity.

It seems possible to correct the line with a slighter change than any
of the above. The translation of the line offers no difficulty as the ms.
reads, some adverb of time is expected in contrast with iam in the next
line. When mane and yarrula are transposed, the only difficulty remain-
ing is the scansion of mane. I would substitute modo for the unmetrical
mane. Modo is found in 112 and 135 in the sense of lately. Mane may
have found its way into the text as a gloss; this would account for its
