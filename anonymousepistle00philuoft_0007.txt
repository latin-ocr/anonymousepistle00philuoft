An Anonymous Eptstle of Dido to Aeneas 5

Anthology, according to which it must be earlier than 534 A. D.
A further indication may possibly be found in the fact that the
poem is anonymous. A number of poems in the Anthology
which are given under the names of their authors have in ad-
dition to the name the title vir clarissimus, vir inlustris, or some
such complimentary expression; from this the conclusion has
been drawn that these poets were contemporaries of the com-
piler of the Anthology.³ Consequently there is a presumption
that the poems which appear without such a title are of earlier
date. While some weight may be given to this evidence, it
cannot be regarded as conclusive, for there is always the pos-
sibility that the name or complimentary title originally attached
to any particular poem may have been lost in copying; also,
while it is not probable that the work of an author still living
would be inserted anonymously in an anthology‚ it is by no
means impossible.

For further evidence we must examine the poem itself. In
two passages4 the author expresses Epicurean views, suggesting
that he was not a Christian. This fact leads Teuffel and Schanz
to date the poem just before the official triumph of Christian-
ity.⁵ Here again we must beware of attaching too much im-
portance to these expressions, for paganism still lived on and
flourished side by side with Christianity long after the official
recognition of the latter.⁶ There were, too, nominal Christians‚
like Ausonius, whose religion rested lightly upon them, and did
not prevent them from employing the old mythological sub-
J'ects and the language of paganism. Further, it must be re-
membered that the opinions which the author attributes to
Dido are not necessarily his own. Consequently‚ while we may
conclude that the author was probably a pagan, we are not jus-
tified in going so far as to say that the poem must have been
written before Christianity became the official religion of Rome.

tentums scheint eine Anzahl von Schriftwerken in gebundener Form zu stam-
men, die sich mit Unbefangenheit oder gar Heiterkeit auf dem Boden der

alten Gotterwelt bewegen und die iiberlieferten Formen meist mit leidlicher
Sicherheit handhaben.''
