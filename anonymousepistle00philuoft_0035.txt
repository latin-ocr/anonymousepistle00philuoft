An Anonymous Epistle of Dido to Aeneas 33

By the life-giving principle of nature earth brings her changes
and gladly summons the breezes of the fostering season; the
fields are clothed again with the thick verdure of grass, the grain
binds its shining tresses, and the advancing season does not
cheat the ears of grain of their promise of a better harvest. Love
alone cannot beguile its own weariness.

The weary plowman unfastens the yoke, and welcomes the
night in answer to his prayers; grateful rest has power to refresh
his toil, sleep, pervading his limbs, is not slow to restore his en-
ergy, and at all times brings tovhusbandmen strength to care
for their fields. Love alone cannot beguile its own weariness.

The seas by their inooming tides restore their shores

69. noctem capit seems to be a reminiscence of Verg. Aen. 4. 529-31
neque umquam

Solvitur in somnos, oculisve aut pectore noctem

Accipit.
Here capit is somewhat stronger than receives or accepts, having rather
the force of captat ; literally, “grasps at the night through prayers.''
reparare labores: ef. Ov. Met. 11. 623—5

Somne, quies rerum, placidissime, Somne, deorum,

Pax animi, quem cura suyit, qui corda diurnis

Fessa ministeriis mulces reparasque labori.

71. ruris: objective genitive with the adjective ministram: “ministering to
