An Anonymous Epistle of Dido to Aeneas 35

again after their losses, the rising waves 01 1116 ever changing
ocean play along the shore, though destined to recede, the tide
rules the deep by its own alternation, and in due succession re-
stores all that is lost. Nature has time to fufill her tasks. Love
alone cannot beguile its own weariness ........
1116 dewy meadows in springtime smile with jewelled roses, and
the fields burst into bloom. The ground is hidden beneath an
embroidery of flowers, and nature, with a riotous abundance of
roses, provides leafy garlands. Love alone cannot beguile its
own weariness. γ

But neither the welcome silence 01 night nor the blessed boon
of sleep brings any relief, nor does love enjoy the gifts of

 

yemmatis: bejewelled with drops 01 dew; suggested by roscida.
Cf. Lucr. 2. 319 Invitant herbae yemrnantes rore recenti.
Culex 70—71 Florida cum tellus aemmantes picta per herbas
Vere notat dubiis distincta coloribus arva.
verni: 1116 1115. reading Vesui (for Vesuvi) is hardly possible. Aside
from the anachronism 01 making Dido mention a place in Italy, as Werns·
dorf points out, there 15 110 reason for the choice of this particular local-
ity. Wernsdorf¹s change to visu is easy palaeographically, but there is
no point in the use 01 11115 word. Riese’s verni or Birt's veris makes much
better sense.
79. For rideo used metaphorically cf.
Catull. 64. 284 Quo permulsa domus iucundo risit odore.
Verg. Ecl. 4. 20 Mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho.
Ov. Met. 15. 204-5 florumque coloribus almas Ridet ayer.
80. Pictas: 01. Lucr. 5. 1395-6
Praesertim cum tempestas ridebat et anni
Tempora pinyebant viridantis floribus herbas.
and Culeae 70-71‚ cited on 78.
fronde coronas: 01. Lucr. 1. 118 perenni fronde coronam.
fronde is ablative 01 material, which is rare without a limiting adjective;
see Lane ἓ 1313 ; but 01. Verg. Aen. 5. 663 pictas abiete puppis.
81. Lascivis: “luxuriant ;’' 01. Hor. Carm. 1. 36. 18-20
nec Damalis novo
Divelletur adultero
Lascivis hederis ambitiosior.
This passage is not quite parallel, for lascivis has a more figurative mean-
ing than in the text.
83. pia: because sleep is a gift 01 1116 gods; 01. Verg. Aen. 2. 269 (quies) dono
divom qratissima serpit.
