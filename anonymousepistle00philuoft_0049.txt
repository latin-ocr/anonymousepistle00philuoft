An Anonymous Epistle of Dido to Aeneas 47

lately shipwrecked you are hurrying to distant seas. You are
afraid to be safer, and yet you know nothing of dangers that are
honorable. While you cherish your evil desires, you alone are
preparing cruel disaster for yourself by your departure. You
fiee, lo! you fiee and abandon my household gods, and leave
the unhappy court of Carthage, which gave you a thro ne,
which encircled your hair with the sacred diadem, placed on
your majestic brow the jewelled constellation, and entrusted
you with my love. You have nothing greater, I think, than
this, and you still reign without a consort, my ungrateful Aeneass
Let anger rule the counsels of one who grieves! But love is.

 

The diadema was originally a purple fillet worn by the Persian king
around the tiara. Among the Romans it was always regarded as a sym-
bol of kingly power. From the time of Constantine it was adopted by
the Caesars as a sign of their imperial dignity; it was often adorned with
a row of pearls or precious stones, or made of gold and jewels. See
Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopddie, and S. M. Stevenson, Dictionary os
Roman Coins, s. v. diadema.

l4l.sidere may refer to the form of the diadem, or merely to the brilliance of
the jewels of which it is composed.

l43.maius: sc. nostro amore from previous line.

144.meus: vocative. Cf. Verg. Aen. 6. 835 sanquis meus.
In early Latin meus is used as vocative only with a noun having the voc-
ative like the nominative; with later writers this rule is not observed.

Cf. Kiihner 1. p. 447. 7.
ira: contrasted with amon cf. 15 ff.

145.vellem: the present subjunctive might have been expected here.
