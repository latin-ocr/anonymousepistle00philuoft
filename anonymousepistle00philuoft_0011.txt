Αη Anonymous Epistle os Dido to Aeneas 9

STYLE AND LITERARY CHARACTERISTICS

By the majority of those who mention it, the poem is briefly
dismissed as a mere rhetorical exercise. Palmer2⁰ is the only
one of its critics who allows it any merit. The choice of a theme
already treated by Vergil and Ovid inevitably challenges com-
parison with the works of those poets, and such comparison is
not to the advantage of our poem. Yet if we accept the au-
thor's own estimate of himself as modicus poeta‚21 and keep in
mind the narrow limits within which he confines his work, it
is not altogether without charm and interest. While in a sense
it is nothing more than a rhetorical exercise‚ a comparison with
the dictiones referred to above shows that it is of much greater
length than they, and much more original in its treatment of
the subject chosen.

&The poet doubtless had Ovid’s epistle of Dido—‘2 before him
as his model. The setting in the story is the same as Ovid's‚
namely the time when Dido asks her sister Anna to carry her
appeals to Aeneas.23 The conception of Dido's character also
is Ovid's rather than Vergil’s—she is gentle and forgiving, re-
signed to death. She reproaches Aeneas, it is true, after the
manner of Vergil's heroine, but her remonstrances are only a
mild echo of Vergil’s passionate words, and her brief anger is
soon suceeded by gentler emotion. Her last wish is for Aeneas'
safetysThe language, as well as the general treatment, is more
suggestive of Ovid than of Vergil, as might be expected; for the
former could be imitated much more easily by a writer of medi-
ocre ability. Again and again phrases occur which echo those
of Ovid,24 showing that the author must have been sufficiently
familiar with his works to reproduce his language unconsciously.

Yet at the same time he altogether lacks the smooth, easy
flow of Ovid's verse. The thought is frequently difficult to
follow, partly because the language is condensed to the point of
obscurity. A noticeable characteristic is a certain poverty of
vocabulary, which shows itself in the repetition of the same

words and phrases, e. g, vota nocentis (39, 99), honesta pericula
(97, 136), peritura (74, 87), perfide (35, 119, 124). Nocens in
