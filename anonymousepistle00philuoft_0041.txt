An Anonymous Epistze os Dido to Aeneas 39

Ι could have scattered your limbs and your hands over the sea,
and hastened your evil day of death in the swelling waves; I
could have snapped the thread of life of the growing boy Iulus
with my own hand, and destroyed his little body by a cruel
death; Ι could have fixed the steel deep in his flesh, or given his
limbs to wild beasts; but the evil impulse has departed, driven
from my heart by love, and love, having endured honorable
dangers‚ has restrained my angry feelings. Who would dare to
commit so great a wrong as this against a guest? Who would
wish to have the curses of one who would do him harm‘?
No love is hidden beneath treachery. Whom will you

 

resolvere: destroy or kill; the simple verb solvo is generally used in this
sense. Cf.

Sen. Epist. 66. 43 alius inter cenandum solutus est.
Tro. 600—601 me sata maturo exitu
Facilique solvant.
Curt. 8.9. 32 corporibus quae senectus solvit.
Flor Epic. 2.21. 11 sic morte quasi somno soluta est.

97. honesta pericula: the phrase occurs again in 136.

98. Corda: “anger'’; cf.
Verg. Aen. 1. 303 ponuntque ferocia Poeni corda.
6. 407 tumida ex ira tum corda residunt.
Val. Flac. 6. 2 (Mars) acri corde tumet.
Sil. 10. 490 mansuescere corda nescia.

in hospite: in two other places in the poem (119 and 132) initial h is
counted as a consonant and makes position. This was the rule in Chris-
tian poets, cf. Miiller pp. 14, 382, 391. It is first found in Porphyrius
(early 4th century), it appears also in J uvencus, Ausonius, Dracontius,
Venantius Fortunatus, Luxorius. Our author is not consistent in his
treatment of initial h, for there are 16 places where, as in classical poetry,
it fails to make position.

99. Hoc nefas: the cruelty which her imagination suggested in 91-96.
vota nocentis: cf. 39.

100. fraude is the easiest emendation for the ms. laude. It is to be taken
closely with the preceding sentences. Fraude here is violation of the

obligations of hospitality; it is because of her love that she cannot harm
Aeneas,
