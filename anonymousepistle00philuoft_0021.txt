An Anonymous Epistle of Dido to Aeneas 19

or in my need I seek in vain the imprecations that I uttered when
encompassed by an evil destiny. Because of love my house is
tottering to its fall, my guiltless sorrow but increases my love.
While my pen in eager haste was striving to give expression to
angry complaints, grief itself stayed my hand, and love, per-
mitting me to say no more, checked both the course of my
thoughts and my words. Ah, how often was my hand recailed
from its task, how often was it poised in doubt! What could
it do with thumb atremble‘? Numbness binds fast hand and
lips, while they are forming the harsh words, and what Ι write
condemns the thought not yet expressed. The pen, guided

 

castus dolor: i. e. grief for the ruin of her house, which is a pure and hon-
orable grief.

16. nec plura etc.: cf. Verg. Aen. 1. 385—ss

nec plara querentem
Passa Venus medio sic interfata dolore est.

18. A quotiens: cf. Ov. Trist. l. 3. 51-4
Ah, quotiens aliquo dixi properante, quid uryes‘?
Vel quo festines ire, vel unde, vide.
Ah, quotiens certam me sum mentitus habere
Horam, praepositae qaae soret apta viae.

dubium: adverbial; the adjective dubia might have been expected.

19. trepidanti pollice: cf. Ov. Met. 9. 520
E't meditata manu componit verba trementi.

pollex may be used for the fingers in general, as in Ov. Amor. 3. 6. 71
Sera tamen scindens inimico pollice crinem.

20. Torpor . . . liqat: cf. Ov. Met. 1. 548
Via: prece finita, torpor gravis alliqat artus.

ora: the ms. ira gives a meaning exactly the opposite of what is requir-
ed. It is ira that urges her to write the harsh words, dolor that checks
her. Ora is supported by Ov. Met. 9. 514—5
Coyet amor, potero; vel si pudor ora tenebit,
Littera celatos arcana fatebitur iqnes.
Riese’s change to ora necessitates the further change of the verb to sor-
mant.

21. condemnat: the ms. commendat cannot be justified. Schrader’s cor-
rection is generally accepted. For the thought cf.
Ov. Epist. 13. 13 Linguaque mandantis verba imperfecta reliquit.
21. 25 Sicut erant properans verba imperfecta relinquo.
Met. 1. 526 Fuyit, cumque ipso verba imperfecta reliquit.
