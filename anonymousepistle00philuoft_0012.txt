10 An Anonymous Epzstle os Dido to Aeneas

different forms occurs six times, and vota eleven times. Quite
striking is a tendency to repeat a word three or four lines after
its first occurrence, e. g. ipse dolor (11), dolor ipse (16), cf. ipse
dolor (89); liqavz't (17), hyat (20); conscia (29 and 32) ; pendet (14),
pependet (18); alitum (56), alit (59); reparare (69), reparant
(73); miseram (90 and 92); manus (92), manu (94>; nefas (97
and 99).

The most original and the best part of the poem is the long
passage²⁵ contrasting the constant changes in nature with the
enduring grief of unhappy love. The idea is by no means new,
but it is developed here to an unusual length and with consider-
able skill. As we should expect, the details are of literary ori-
gin, not drawn directly from nature. The passage is divided
into stanzas of equal length by the refrain Sua taedia solus sal-
lere nescit amor. Less effective is the second refrain‚2⁶ Cuz· diq-
na rependes, si mihi dura paras? It does not mark off a dis-
tinct division of the poem, as does the first one, the stanzas are
not so clearly separated in thought, and one of them is longer
by a line than the others.

A marked feature of the poem is the use that is made of allit-
eration. The following lines show striking instances of this:

8. modo, me mayis, mortis Α 78-9. roscida, rident, rosis
15. calamus celerare querellas 87. vota, vellem
17. vias et verba 92. membra manus, miseram
27—8. conubium, crimen, credula, 95. morte, mersum, figere serrum
cuncta 96. pectore pulsum
40. verba, voco, vulnera 97. pericula passus
