6 An Anonymous Epistlc os Dido to Aeneas

Aside from the foregoing indications‚ we have only the evi-
dence of language and style, an uncertain means of determin-
ing the date of a poem so short as this, so imitative, and so full
of reminiscences of earlier authors. The writer was conscious-
ly using Vergil and Ovid as models; his diction frequently echoes
that of other Classical poets. Thus the language of his own
time is overlaid with that of the writers whom he imitates. We
may, however, note the following indications of later date:

(1) Metre. The metre is correct according to classical stand-
ards, except that in three places⁷ initial h is counted as a con-
sonant in making position. This is a peculiarity of Christian
poetry‚ and first appears in the fourth century.8 Our author
does not follow this rule consistently, for in sixteen places h is
treated just as in verse of the classical period. Elision is re-
markably rare, occurring only five times.⁹

(2) syntax. The following variations from classical usage
occur:1⁰

Double neqative for emphasis (29).

Fruor with the accusative case (49).

Licet as a conjunctior] with the pluperfect subjunctive (115)
and with the indicative (148—9). The former is first found in
the early imperial period, the latter from the time of Apuleius.

Perfect infinitive used with the force of the present (115, 128).
This is not peculiar to late Latin, but becomes more frequent
in the later period, and according to Schmale is a favorite use
with Christian writers.

⁹56, 95, 98, 110, 147.

The infrequency of elision is not of much value in establishing the date;
from the time of the Silver Age elision was avoided by some poets, but there
is no regular decrease in the frequency of its occurrence3 cf. E. H. Sturtevant
and R. G. Kent, Transactions os the American Philoloyical Αεεοείαίίοη, 46,
pp. 146 ff.

Birt (pp. 61-2) points out a further peculiarity in the very frequent use
of two caesuras, dividing the line into three parts. He finds the same peculi-
arity in the short poem of 20 lines on Phaedra, attributed to Vincentius (Anth.
279). On these grounds he concludes that this epistle also is the work of Vin-
centius. These metrical peculiarities are not in themselves sufficient reason
for attributing the two poems to the same author, in the absence of other
marked resemblances; moreover, the poem on Phaedra is much more faulty
metrically, containing several mistakes in quantity within its short limits.
