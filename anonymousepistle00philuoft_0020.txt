An Anonymous Epistle os Dido to Aeneas

Quae maledicta dedi, miseris circumdata fatis.
Pendet amore domus, castus dolor auget amorem.
Dum studet iratas calamus celerare querellas,
Continuit dolor ipse manus, nec plura loquentem
Passus amor, mentisque vias et verba ligavit.

A, quotiens revocata manus dubiumque pependit!
Quid factura fuit trepidanti pollice? Dextram
Torpor et ora ligat, dum dura vocabula formant,
Et minus explicitam condemnat littera vocem.

the text, that of Traube, is palaeographically easy, involving only one
change, reyna to eyena. The thought (10—13) is: “1 ought to feel only
anger, but when I try to reproach you, grief overcomes me3 I cannot nOW,
even though I wish, bring myself to utter such bitter reproaches as 1
used at first, when my wrong was still fresh in my mind.’' The substi-
tution of reyna may be explained on the supposition that the scribe may
have looked ahead to domus in 14, or that he was influenced by the re
in requiro.

maledicta: such as those which Vergil makes her utter, Aen. 4. 365—387;
and her dying prayer, 612-629.

This line has been generally regarded as corrupt, and has called forth a
great variety of emendations. The ms. reading, however, may be explain-
ed so as to make good sense, and should therefore be retained. The diffi-
culty is in pendet. Wernsdorf explains it as equivalent to in ruinam pen-
det, pessum daca est. This is not an unnatural extension of the usual
meaning of the word, and is paralleled by Lucan. 1. 24 At nunc semirutis
pendent quod moenia tectis. It is used with the meaning which labor has
in Verg. Aen. 4. 318 miserere domus labentis, which the poet doubtless
had in mind. It is also supported by the couplet on Venus, Anth. 56
Uritur iyne suo fumantibus Aetna cavernis.
Pendet amore Venus: uritur iyne suo.
In the latter Riese explains pendet as = suspensa est.
