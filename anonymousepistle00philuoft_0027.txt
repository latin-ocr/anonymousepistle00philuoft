An Anonymous Epistle of Dido to Aeneas 25

the destiny that controls all things. If it is fated that you go,
I acquiesce 3 for it is because you fiee to a place from which re-
turn is possible, that you carry with you the curses of one who
would do you harm. But it is of no avail that in my complaints
I call your words and your faithlessness cruel. Let all who weep
for my wrongs deny that hatred was their cause; chance draws
all things in its train.

While nature hastens on its appointed course, love alone can-

not beguile its own weariness. Cynthia renews her splendor

 

39. Nihil est etc.: the abrupt change of thought represents the sudden var-

iation of Dido’s mood as she wavers between anger and resignation; cf.
6—26 and 125.

dura: predicate adjective with both verba and fidem. Hence fidem =
lack of saith.

querellis: cf. Verg. Aen. 4. 360
Desine meque tuis incendere teque querellis.

41. Invidiam: subject of secisse.
trahit omnia casus: cf. Cic. Epist. 4. 12. 1 quoniam casus et natura in
nobis dominatur.

Verg. Aen. 9. 723 qui casus ayit res.
Ov. Met. 7. 815 and Trist. 2. 341 me mea fata trahebant.
Ars 3. 425 Casus ubique valet.
Anth. 38. 1 Omnia casus ayit.
For the Epicurean sentiment cf. 121-2.
42. taedia: cf. Ov. Epist. 3. 139
Aut si versus amor tuus est in taedia nostri.

42-43. sua . . . amor: this refrain is repeated nine times, marking
off the different aspects of nature whose changes are contrasted with
the unchanging grief of love. The refrain probably originated among
the artificialities of Alexandrian poetry. It was used by Theocritus (l
and 2), and from him was adopted by Vergil in Ecl. 8. Catullus em-
ploys it in three poems (61, 62, 64), and Ovid twice makes use of it (Epist.
9, Am. 1. 6). It is also found in the Pervigiliurn Veneris, in Nemesianus
(Ecl. 4), and in Calpurnius Siculus (Ecl. 11). None of these shows the
refrain divided between two lines, as here.

43. Fallere: cf. Verg. Aen. 4. 85 infandum si fallere possit amorem.

Ov. Trist. 3. 2. 16 Fallebat curas aeqraque corda labor.

Reparatum: cf. Hor. Carm. 4. ’7. 13
. Damna tamen celeres reparant caelestia lunae.
Ov. Met. 1. 11 N ec nova crescendo reparabat cornua Phoebe.
The participle is used proleptically—“forms so that it is renewed.’'
