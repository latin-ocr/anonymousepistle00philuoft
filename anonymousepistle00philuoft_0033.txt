An Anonymous Epistle os Dido to Aeneas 31

she finds in love the compensation for her wrong, and though
she will again cherish her sorrowful complaints, she now at
night represses the laments which she utters in the day.
Love alone cannot beguile its own weariness.

ί Now the ardor of well-mated love fosters the lover's affection,
and the fidelity of the marriage chamber is made perfect by
those who pledge it, the wife rejoioing in her husband, the hus-
band happy in his wife. Love reviews its desires and secret
j0ys; sleep and night complete their wedded harmony. JssQXQ
alone cannot beguile its ojyn weariness.«

 

Cf. Porphyrio’s scholium on Hor. Epod. 2. 26 “Queruntur‚” inquit,
quoniam veteres omnium animalium voces praeterquam hominum “que-
rellas'' dicebant. For a discussion of this use of queror see T. Frank,
American Journal of Philoloqy 34, p. 322.

58. iunctus: transferred epithet. Cf. Ov. Epist. 13. 117 Quando erit ut
lecto mecum bene iunctus in uno.

amantem: there is no need of Maehly’s somewhat prosaio change to the
plural.

59. piqnera: cf. 109, where the form piynore is used.

60. Cf. Ov. Met. 7. 799 Coniuye eram felix, selisc erat illa marito. Coniunx
and maritus are in apposition with piynora. The emphasis is on the ad-
jectives laeta and felix rather than on the nouns, i. e. the fact that hus-
band and wife rejoice in each other is a pledge that they will be faithful
to each other.

62. Concordat: cf. Perviy. Ven. 3 Vere concordant amores.
Papin. Dig. 48. 5. 12 bene concordatum matrimonium.
Concordo is more commonly intransitive, but the Thesaurus cites a num-
ber of instances of its transitive use, as here.
63. semine rerum: cf. Lucr. 1. 58-60
Quae (primordia) nos materiem et qenitalia corpora rebus
Reddunda in ratione vocare et semine rerum
Appellare suemus.
Ov. Met. 1. 419 secundaque semina rerum.
This is one of the expressions that show the influence of Epicureanism
on our author; cf. 41 and 121-2.
