An Anonymous Epistle of Dido to Aeneas 41

worthily repay‚ if you desire cruelty for me?

While prolonging with laments and sighs the story of un-
happy Creusa's fate, Ι offered unutterable prayers to the gods,
and I grieved for her wrong and her evil destiny as you told the
tale; I was myself the first to give way to the siglis and tears of
an anguished mind. Whom will you worthily repay, if you de-
sire cruelty for me?

Sweet Ascanius earessed my neck, and the boy pierced my
heart with a hapless passion; while my sense of duty desired
merely to restore to him his lost mother, love, with lying prom-
ise, made the name a true one, and grief, shown in sympathy,
uttered deep sighs and imprinted kisses. Whom will you worth-

106-7.Cf. Verg. Aen. 1. 685-8

Ut, cum te yremio accipiet laetissima Dido,
Reyales inter mensas laticemque Lyaeum,
Cum dabit ampleaeus atque oscula dulcia fiyet,
Occultum inspires iynem fallasque veneno.

and 1. 717-9 Haec oculis, haec pectore tolo
Haeret, et interdum premio fovet, inscia Dido
I nsidat quantus miserae deus.

107. Birt rejects this line because this “stanza’' is longer by a line than the
others. He thinks it was added by an interpolator who felt that the
name of Ascanius was required. But with the line omitted the sense is
not clear. It seems better to attribute the extra line to the writer’s care-
lessness or Iack of skill than to interpolation. Birt objects to Ouden-
dorp’s conjecture fiyebat on account of the recurrence of the word in
110; but this may be really an argument in its fav0r; see Introduction
p. 10.

108. fides: faithfulness to the requirements of hospitality. Dido's kindness
to Ascanius was at first prompted merely by a sense of duty to the
motherless boy.

109.mentito piqnore: i. e. the false hopes of happiness which love aroused·
The juxtaposition of verum and mentito is no doubt intentional.
nomen: i. e. of “mother.''

110.fi9it governs qemitus as well as oscula—zeugma.
oscula fiqit: cf. Verg. Aen. 1. 687 oscula dulcia fiqet.
111. Confessus: passive meaning.
